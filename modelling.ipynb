It would appear that bandits have been attacking the nearest town, and it looks like the bandits have had enough time to begin planning on their next move.\n","\n","The bandits' plan is to sneak into the town and make their escape. They should then be able to hunt down the guards, who will likely try to stop them.

Don’t worry about it, it took you a long time to warm up…but it looks like a nice, warm place right now! If it really were warm like that, you’d be doing the girl a favour in that situation, I think. I know you were having lunch so I assume you’re still here.” You hear another man ask one of the women.\n","\n","\n","Once again, the other man stands by the door, which opens to the front, revealing a little room with a desk, and a single shelf in the middle.\n","\n","\n","“Oh no, these are the shelves that Mary and I used to use to store our equipment on! I wasn’t sure if either of them would last in a tent that small, so the way this is a good thing, let’s put them into the right containers, or else the bed here won’t last long.

Anyway, I’m telling you to get this.” Mary says.\n","\n","\n","You take their bags and then the one she gave you, and quickly load up the thing and put it into the bag they’re going to put in to the tent, with a little extra clothes.

The girl just came out. You have a small pile of clothes, which you hope might fit in there, and a couple of things of your own with the things in them.

It seems like everyone has just been very lucky, the ride seems to be going pretty well; all you can think about is leaving now and leaving all those riding by yourself and the rain band behind you.\n","\n","You are on the verge of tears when this happens. The ride in front seems alright, you know there is a little risk of losing the rain band and rain band on your arm, but if they all do that, it doesn’t matter if you are going to make it, the rain band on your arm will still save your life.\n","\n","When you are at your wits end, you take a calming breath and start to cry.

It's an interesting idea, but one that you could never sustain. You'd be at it for years, never quite feeling it, and it would be easier than ever if you could just be a normal guy, living the same life as everyone else.\n","\n","So instead you take what you have, and the last thing you want is to be remembered. You put the memories of where you used to live up front. And it works.\n","\n","But eventually one day, one of the party goes down to investigate and no matter how hard you try you can't make him leave you alone. One day, he comes back and says you have nothing to show for himself. He tells you to go back to home and sleep.\n","\n","You tell him that you are glad he saw you again, that you have a job right around the corner, and that you will be going with him, and you agree.\n","\n","You tell him you will be coming with him on a short tour as well, after that point he can leave you alone and the rest of the party.\n","\n","You leave and go home, and you leave the others hanging. Your dad is very disappointed, but says that it's not his fault. It's just that you didn't make enough of an effort when you were younger. You think it's pretty impressive that you didn't get caught, but that's just the way it is.\n","\n","As for your mom, you think it's a fairly decent job and she still takes care of you. If she had given you a real job, you would of been able to support yourself in the home. You can only hope she didn't think you weren't working hard though, because she probably would have given you some leeway.\n","\n","You also wonder what kind of job she would be had you gone to college. Was she a lawyer, or a doctor? She probably worked in a hospital as well, and she was probably less stressed over the course of the day, as you found out later.\n","\n","You wonder if you could still find a way to make time for you, to spend time with you, to do whatever you wanted with her in your life.\n","\n","Even if your mom would be happy to have you around at school, she probably wouldn't want you to think about her in any kind of romantic manner. She probably would tell you off if she saw you talking, and maybe even if she didn't, she had at least some sense of right to be upset.\n","\n","It might be too much to ask your mom to see more of you, of a life of your own, but you know if she did, she would be disappointed. It would be hard to forgive yourself, but you know even if she couldn't forgive you, she would just feel bad about not being there.\n","\n","Though you would probably want to try to make that happen, in order to fix your mother in some way.\n","> You wait as long as you can before your mom sees you\n","Not too long, you wonder, but not too long, you still can go on to the next life.\n","\n","You get back home, you have a hard time getting yourself out of bed, you think back to what Dad said to you.\n","\n","You wonder if you could still find a way to make time for you, to spend time with you, to do whatever you wanted with her in your life.\n","\n","You think about what you were able to make happen and wonder if there was even anyone else that was successful in that regard. One has to think something about your father since you never really had a real father figure in your short life.\n","\n","That's what you really ponder, and you wonder if he was right.\n","\n","You never really had any one, just an ordinary guy. The only one that ever really had an impact on you was your mother. You don't think maybe you could have done that if you had been raised by some decent individual. Maybe you could have found a different path. You don't know, but then again, what would you know.\n","\n","You still wonder if it would have been better if your parents had just died of natural causes or if they had at least kept them in their prime.

You don't think you ever would have been as successful, but you know that something good would have happened. You know that something good is just around the corner.\n","\n","You wonder if you could even be a better dad to other kids if you were raised by someone with similar circumstances. You don't mean with your own parents, you mean just from having grown up by them. And maybe having grown up by one can help in life as well.
